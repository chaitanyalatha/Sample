Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.
It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.
As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

Version control:- Takes every change as one version, so that we can go back and check the changes.

Centralized Version control:-
At single point of failure like when the server was down, the changes committed by the developers will not be committed into the Git or Remote repository.

Distributed Version control:-
Developers will create repos in their machines and then they will push the branch to the Git/Remote repo.
When the server failure occurs, they can recollect the code from their repo in their machines.

Workflow:-
There are three stages in Git.
Working directory - our copy in our machine.
Staging area - working on changes of code before committing.
Remote location - Git Repo.
